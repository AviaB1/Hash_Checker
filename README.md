# Hash_Checker
Hash Checker is a Python script that scans files in a directory for their hash values and checks them against two online services, VirusTotal and AlienVault, to determine if the files are malicious.

## Features
- Scans files in a specified directory for their hash values.
- Checks the hash values against VirusTotal and AlienVault databases.
- Prints the results of the scans, indicating whether the files are clean or malicious.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, you need to obtain API keys for VirusTotal and AlienVault. You can sign up for an account and get the API keys from their respective websites.

## Disclaimer
I didn't conduct tons of tests and check every single edge case, so bugs are expected to some extent. Maybe in the near future, I'll add more functionalities to the tool and make it a serious project, but for the time being - it is what it is. Additionally, I'm aware that the code lacks some functionalities, but I did this project just for the fun of it and nothing more. I'm sure there are projects that are way better than this one.
